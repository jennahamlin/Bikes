# UCI race calender by month for 2018

### January 6, 2018: This uses only general lat and long for each country which is listed on the UCI All Competitions website. Currently, it also is only for Men Elite.


#### If someone were to download the exact latitude and longitude for each race for the Men's Elite, updating that to this file would be straightforward and would provide a pop up point for actual start location, which would be a better visual. Also, if multiple races happen in a country during the same month because I used the same lat long based on country for all races, then only one race is displayed. 


#### The basis of this map was forked from CJ-Jewell/Interactive-Map-with-Mapbox

#### Also, figure out how to have additional data displayed for each point. For example I would like to include the start date, end date, and name of race.
